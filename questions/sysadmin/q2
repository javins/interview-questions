The /etc/passwd format looks like:

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
puppet:x:54:54:Puppet:/var/lib/puppet:/sbin/nologin

In a language of your choice, write a program that reads /etc/passwd and
prints a list of username:shell sorted by username to a different file.

Using the data above, the new file would look like:

puppet:/sbin/nologin
root:/bin/bash
