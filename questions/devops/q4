If we list all the natural numbers <= 20 that are multiples of 3 xor 5, we get:

3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 18, 20

Note, 15 is not included because multiples of both 3 and 5 are excluded from
the above series.

The sum of these multiples is 83.

In a language of your choice, write a program that takes a postive integer
'N' as an argument and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 xor 5 <= N.

Build (if necessary) and execute this program. You can use the following test
cases to check your work:

$ ./q4 5
8
$ ./q4 20
83
$ ./q4 50
503
