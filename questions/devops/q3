If we list all the natural numbers <= 20 that are multiples of 3 xor 5, we get:

3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 18, 20

Note, 15 is not included because multiples of both 3 and 5 are excluded from
the above series.

In a language of your choice, write a program that takes a positive integer
'N' as an argument and prints all multiples of 3 xor 5 up to (and including) N.

Build (if necessary) and execute this program. You can use the following
examples to check your work:

$ ./q3 5
3
5

$ ./q3 20
3
5
6
9
10
12
18
20
