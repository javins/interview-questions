In a language of your choice, write a program that takes a single positive
integer 'N' as a command line argument and prints all the integers from 1 to N
(inclusive).

Build (if necessary) and execute this program. You may use the following
examples to check your work:

$ ./a2 5
1
2
3
4
5

$ ./a2 10
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
